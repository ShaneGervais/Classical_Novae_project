# Classical Novae Project

This project is to investigate the nuclear interactions between two stars in a binary system. The exchange of matter between, for example, a white dwarf (WD) and a main sequence star, forming an accretion disk in between the stellar objects. White dwarfs are rich in CO and ONe, dying from a 7-8 solar mass star after subsequent H- and He-burning.

In this project we use the MESA software for simulating the stellar evolution during the classical novae process. We start by running MESA for three different mass exchange rates being $\dot{M} = $

1. $10^{-8} M_{\odot}/yr$

2. $10^{-9} M_{\odot}/yr$

3. $10^{-10} M_{\odot}/yr$
